# Assignment 5
## Objectives

To gain experience writing functions and using recursion.

### Part 1

1. Write a program `three.c` that takes in 3 user-input integers and checks whether or not the 3 integers form a valid triangle (no one side is longer than the sum of the other 2 sides).  It should contain the following functions: 
    - `isTriangle()`, which determines whether the integers form a valid triangle
    - `triangleType()`, which determines whether the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal), isoceles (only 2 sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal) and prints a message as appropriate
    - `sanitizedInput()`, which ensures that the user-input integers are valid

2. Write a program `palindrome.c` using recursion to test if a word/phrase is a palindrome (something that reads the same if the letters are reversed, such as racecar).

### Part 2

In a text file `assignment5.txt`, answer the following questions:

1.  What do each of the following mean?  Include a description of the syntax or an example.
      - Passing by value:
      - Passing by reference:
      - Passing call-by-value

2.  What is the function of the return statement in C?

3.  What is the purpose of writing functions? 

4.  When would you use Call by Value and when would you use Call by Reference?
