1. Passing by value : It is when a function uses a copy of an argument, so that the variables are unchanged. Most data type arguments are passed by value. (thing1 and thing2 are not effected)
		int something(thing1,thing2){
			int thing1+thing2;}
		
		int thing1;
		int thing2;
		something(thing1,thing2);

1b. Passing by reference : It is when a function is given the memory address of a passed variable, so that the function can change the value. 
		for (int x=0;x<strlen(str);x++){
			str[i]=1;
		return str;}

2. The return statement temporarily saves a variable which can be accessed in the main function.

3. Functions are efficient because they can be used multiple times without needing to rewrite the wholecode, and also makes bug fixing the program easier.
