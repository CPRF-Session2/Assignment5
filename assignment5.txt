1.
Pass by value- Arguments in argument list are passed to a function. There is a value being copied to the function's
formal parameters.  Basic data type (char,int,etc) arguments are passed by value and are local to the function they are in. An example of this is

int sum(int a, int b){
	total = a + b;
	return total;
}
int x = 2;
int y = 1;

int var = sum(2,1);
In the example, you are passing the values of the variable to the function.

Passing by reference-Modifing originsl memeory location 
insdie a function. Arrays are passed by reference. As an example, let's say you have an array in a function. It is arr[5]= {1,2,3}; Let's say you have an array in another function and it is arr2[5]= {1,2,4}. Let's say you pass this array to the other one. Now the memory of the first array has been changed to hold the 4 instead of the 3.

The function of return is to return flow of control to where the function where it is in was called.

3.
The purpose of functions in C is to be reuable code that preforms a specific task and directs flow to itself. After distant code completes, it returns to where it was called from.
