1a. Passing by value means a copy is made of the passed value to be used locally by the function.

int fnx(int a)
{
	a = 0;
	return a;
}

1b. Passing by reference means the memory address of the passed variable is sent to the function, allowing the function to change the variables value globally, not just locally.
int fnx(char str[50])
{
	for(int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
	{
		str[i] = i;
	}
	return str;
}

2. The return statement stops any more code from running in a function, and sends data back to the main function, if the return statement is in another function.

3. Functions can be used to reuse code with having to rewrite it, and allows the programmer to easily use algorithims when needed.
